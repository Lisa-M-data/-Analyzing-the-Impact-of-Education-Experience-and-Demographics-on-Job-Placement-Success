Title: Analyzing the Impact of Education, Experience, and Demographics on Job Placement Success
Hypothesis:
There is a significant relationship between job placement success and factors such as previous work experience, GPA, and degree type, with work experience being the strongest predictor of job placement.

Variables: Dependent Variable:
Job Placement Status (Placed/Not Placed)

Independent Variables:
Age GPA Degree Gender Major Previous Work Experience College Name

Why I Chose This Topic:
Through my experience as an Enrollment Advisor, Career Coach, and Talent Sourcer, I have closely observed the factors that influence candidates' career outcomes. This project seeks to identify the key independent variables—such as GPA, major, and previous work experience—that most significantly impact job placement success. By analyzing these factors, I aim to uncover insights that can help refine career support strategies and improve job placement rates for future job seekers.

Data:
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 700 records with 8 variables:

Gender, Age, Degree, Stream (Major), College Name, Placement Status (dependent variable), GPA, and Years of Experience. Approach:

Data Cleaning:
Checked for missing values, dropped null entries, and converted categorical variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized distributions of placement status, gender, age, majors, etc., using bar charts, boxplots, and scatter plots.

Statistical Analysis:
Performed chi-square tests for independence to assess correlations between variables like GPA, experience, gender, and placement status. Modeling:

Applied multiple models:
Decision Tree Classifier (achieved 98.2% accuracy), Support Vector Machine (77% accuracy), and Linear Regression.

Final Conclusions:
Multiple Variables Influence Job Placement: The study suggests that a combination of factors, such as GPA, previous work experience, and major, play a crucial role in influencing job placement outcomes. While certain factors like age and gender may have some influence, they are likely secondary to skills and relevant experience.

The Importance of Work Experience: Previous work experience seems to be one of the most significant predictors of whether a candidate is placed. Regardless of the degree or college attended, having relevant internships or jobs during college is a key factor in securing a job post-graduation.

GPA and Academic Achievement: GPA remains an important criterion for employers, but its influence might be stronger in certain industries like consulting, finance, or research. However, for many candidates, experience and skills may outweigh GPA once a certain threshold has been met.

Industry-Specific Variability: The importance of each factor (e.g., GPA, degree, major) can vary by industry. For example, tech companies might place a higher emphasis on skills and previous work experience (such as coding projects, internships, etc.), while fields like consulting or finance might prioritize academic achievement more.

Networking and College Prestige Matter: Candidates from prestigious universities or those who have strong networks (e.g., alumni, internships, career fairs) may have better chances of securing jobs, but this is less of a factor in fields that rely more on demonstrable skills and work experience.
